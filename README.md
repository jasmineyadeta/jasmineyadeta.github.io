# Personal Website: jasmineyadeta.github.io

This is the first iteration of my personal website. This is a work-in-progress. If you have any questions, you are welcome to email me.

This is originally a bootstrap template found here: https://bootstrapmade.com/bethany-free-onepage-bootstrap-theme/. You can purchase the Bethany pro to get rid of the footer credit link as I did.
