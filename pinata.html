      <p class="case-study-paragraph">During my most recent position at BBTV, I got the opportunity to learn and lead through <b>the product lifecycle of an innovative and new eCommerce platform including </b>— product vision and strategy, customer requirements, roadmap and SOW development, leading the UI/UX and development teams, feature prioritizing and stakeholder management. </p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">I was tasked to <b>lay down the foundation for an innovative eCommerce platform to service influencers and creators</b> as it aligned with larger scale business initiatives. </p>

      <h3 class="case-study-small-header">WHAT I DID</h3>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">My Role</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">At BBTV, I was given the oppourtunity to <b>champion this eCommerce platform</b>. My work is under an NDA, but some of the work I did was: </p>
      <ul class="case-study-list">
        <li>Led discussions with leadership for vision development with user research</li>
        <li>Create a full SOW and negotiated with developers for timeline, cost, features etc.</li>
        <li>Identify a key features to implement and prioritize </li>
        <li>Lead the UI/UX and development teams (2 teams, 6 people)</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- <p class="case-study-paragraph">After consolidating all the research and proposed solutions, I prioritized a list of key themes and major pain points. Then, I wireframed design explorations and flows to <b>set the project vision</b> and used the list of themes to determine an MVP for the project.</p> -->
      <div class="large-spacing"></div>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">The Impact</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Soft launch is scheduled for the end of this year while the go to market strategy is currently being developed</p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">This service design work is projected to increase value add utility from creators and provide an alternative revenue stream significatnly increasing the versitility of offerings provided by the eCommerce department.</p>

      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Challenges</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-title">Wide Scope & Clouded Vision</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-small-less-wide">It required substancial research to fully map out the business case we were building the prodcut for and it resulted in a prelimiary vision that was trying to solve too many probelms and lacked specificity. </p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-title">Balancing Priorities</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-small-less-wide"> As any typical product project, everything is important and everything needs to be done, so I had to think of creative measures to highlight priority and feature prioritization in the development to get all stakeholders on board.</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-title">Flexibility in a Tumultuous Market</p>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph-small-less-wide">The creator and entertainment space is fluculating causing constantly redefining of product landscape and re-evaluating completitors squeezing into target market territory we were trying to enter. This required an agile mindset and thorough understanding of where our product fit into the already crowded space.</p>

        <h3 class="case-study-small-header">GATHERING CONTEXT</h3>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Research</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">I started by speaking with stakeholders and all involved parties who were part of the high level development of the project. By gathering context, it helped me understand the needs, wants and goals of the product and identify the problem space better before diving into further.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="text-image-card-paragraph">After getting an initial understanding of what we wanted the project to be, I looked into competitors in the space along two major axises, and placed ourselves where we fit in the space. The competitor space was crowded and I focused on what will help us stand out. </div>

        </div>
        <div class="text-image-card-paragraph">I conducted user research into the ideal clientele behind the product, what they are doing that's similar and how we measure up in the landscape.

      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Creating the Scope of Work (SOW)</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">From my research, I broke down the project and its complexities — the vision, core functionality, deadlines, resource allocations including any edge cases and redundancies.</p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">I created a foundational document that <b>consciely and accurately outline the scope, goals, objectives and deliverables of the project</b>. In addition, I created an internal baseline documentation to ensure alignment on product vision and goals.</p>

    <div class="case-study-section-info-container">
         <p class="case-study-paragraph">After a few discussions, our team decided to <b>focus on not compromising most eCommerce experiences</b> Although we wanted a fun and interative eCommerce site, they could not come at the sacrifice of typical eCommerce features because of our focused user base.</p>
         <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph"><b>I collaborated with UI/UX to design a matrix of gamification features and eCommerce elements that would have to be compromised or altered if implemented to highlight to stakeholders the impact of some decisions.</b></p>

        <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Buy In</h1>

        <p class="case-study-paragraph">With the scope and goals defined (and redefined), I was able to move forward with development. During this time I also set the success metrics for this project for pre and post development.</p>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">I ensured in my original SOW and throughout the iterative process, that implementation of elements stakeholders could see were completed regularly to ensure visibility in the progress of the project. <b>I reprioritized features and development as necessary to keep on track but also give reportable, tangible updates.</b></p>
      <div class="large-spacing"></div>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Synthesis and Prioritizing Themes</h1>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph"> <b>I prioritized feedback with the MoSCow and Rice methods </b> of prioritization to ensure appropriate pain points were being addressed first looking at impact, time, risk etc.</p>
      <div class="large-spacing"></div>
      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Solutioning and Executing the Vision</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">I explored several different solutions and flows before coming up with a proposal for the future vision. I wireframed the UI for this ideal flow and iterated on it based on feedback from users and stakeholders.</p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Balancing the technical requirements and timelines, I made <b>set the direction on what an MVP would look like</b>. Since I understood how the platform worked through my research and SOW development, I also laid out the relevant teams interactions and flow</p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">There were many tradeoffs I had to make during development due to things taking longer than anticipated in development - or things just not turning out as expected, I ensured with every deviation that I laid out the potential risks associated with my decisions to be further iterated on.</p>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph"> Coordination between our internal IT and external developers required clear and consise communication on security requirements for the project.

      <h1 class="case-study-large-header">Learnings</h1>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">Throughout this experience, I got to wear many different hats and learn about a product from all angles — vision development, research methods, approval, scoping out problems, delivering a SOW, testing, security, and more.</p>
      <div class="paragraph-spacing"></div>
      <p class="case-study-paragraph">It was an interesting business case to solve that lent itself to a crowded competitor space, so I had to learn how to consolidate a lot of information and ideas into an actionable solution. It allowed me to lay out all the groundwork but also see a product through the development, testing and GTM stages. </p>
